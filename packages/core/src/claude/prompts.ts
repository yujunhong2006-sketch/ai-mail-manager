/**
 * Prompt builders for the AI tasks.
 *
 * Triage has two variants because the two transports have different powers
 * (#105). The Claude Code CLI runs with `allowedTools: ["Bash"]` and can curl a
 * message body out of the local API when sender + subject are not enough; a
 * hosted vendor gets no tools, so that paragraph would be dead text — and it
 * carries `API_SECRET`, which has no business being posted to a third party.
 *
 * Neither variant inlines a body. `claudeUsage.ts` publishes that triage sends
 * sender/subject/snippet/labels and fetches a body only on demand, and the
 * landing page derives its disclosure from that module; inlining bodies for
 * hosted providers would make a public statement false. The cost is that hosted
 * triage is marginally weaker on ambiguous messages, which both prompts already
 * tolerate ("a body is never required for a result").
 *
 * The filter-suggest prompt still branches on whether the user supplied an
 * instruction, and the reply prompt is unchanged.
